            <li>Given: Five elements all labeled with "A" which is followed by a "#" indicating which element it is.</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Some, however, are used in several Depts</li>
            <li>Your help may be needed to prevent confusion between Depts
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Example:</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>) Assigning variables to represent individual ‘bits’ of a ‘byte’ can be confusing at best. 
        For example: the ‘byte’ A=(1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0) has 8-bits. 
        <ol type="a">
            <li>) It is very common to use subscripts to represent each bit: eg A0 ,A1 ,A2 ,A3 ,A4 ,A5,A6 ,A7 where the first index = 0, however, the first index will often start with 1: eg  A1 ,A2 ,A3 ,A4 ,A5,A6 ,A7 ,A8 . You may want to try to have “everyone” use one or the other. No matter what you decide, the problem won’t go away entirely because ‘data sheets’ the Designer uses will contain both depending upon which 74LS-- IC they are dealing with. NOTE: In “Digital” you can create subscripts, A5 but NOT in “Fritzing”: A5.
            </li>
            <li>) The order of bits can make a difference: 
                    does (1, 0, 1, 0) == (0, 1, 0, 1) ? Possible! If one person orders the bits Right-to-Left and another person orders the bits Left-to-Right the answer is “YES” they are equal. 
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>) It is customary to use the terms: “Most Significant Bit” (MSB) and “Least Significant Bit” (LSB) to make clear what order is intended. Eg (0, 1, 0, 1)LSB  or MSB(0, 1, 0, 1).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>) By convention, when the Byte is expressed horizontally, the bit on the right is the LSB.
                                    You should follow this.  
                                    </li>
                                    <li>) It is EASY in ever phase (Design, Draft, Build) to mix the wires up so that one person’s MSB is connected to another person’s LSB. The results are devastating and trouble shooting could prove quite difficult. Make sure everyone is aware of this potential problem.
