                            <p>While this project involves HS students only, my second project
                            involves HS students working with K-3 students. This was motivated by observations during my 
                            one month on the Cheyenne Indian Reservation in 2022 and by the Math and English Test scores of
                            a significant number of students of all ages on the South Dakota proficiency Tests. 
                            The low (very low) scores for the Native Americans was mind blowing. But what to do?
                            </p>
                            <p>I only worked directly with the youth(ages 5-10) once. Daniel brought me 10 kids one day unexpectedly. 
                                I happened to have charged 2 of the 15 Sphero robots, which someone had donated to CRYP several years ago.
                                Unfortunately
                                they had lost the battery charger so I was only to get 2 of the Spheros somewhat charged (eg 2 mins worth of operation!).
                                It was just enough, however, to see how much fun the kids had as they sent the two Spheros all around the Gym and, at the same time chasing after them.
                                But I was also aware of my feelings of "not wanting to work with the youth", a feeling that would pop up again when Gene 
                                asked me to teach the Algebra II class here. After that one semester Gene asked me to teach an Algebra I and Algebra II class.
                                I entertained the thought but told him
                            </p>
                            
                            
                            The only solution I could come up with, is a summer program, continuing every year, which would
                            involve working with the low grades starting with K or pre K students.</p>
                            <p>This program would involve many activities where each activity would have specific goals for 
                                both English and Math. Some Examples:
                            </p> 
                            <ol>
                                <li></li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>--> 
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
