                <p>DB&E Inc is a 1970 "simulated company" that predates Apple Inc's begining by approximately 7 years.
                    It is DB&E Inc's goal to design and build a fully functional 8-bit computer similar to the Apple II, albeit,
                    with somewhat less functionality(eg switches vs keyboard and 7-Segment Displays vs Monitor).
                </p>
                <p>The company's structure will consist of "CEO" and five departments: Engineering, Drafting,
                    Technician, Computer, and Media Arts. Applications are now being accepted for those six positions.
                    Each chosen applicant will fill one of those positions. 
                </p>
                <p>While each person will have the responsibility as a Manager, they will also be called upon to 
                    be workers under any or all of the other Departments at any time. This project is designed at a level such that
                    no Chesterton student should find themselves overwhelmed! It is expected that, at anytime you find yourselves
                    unable to figure something out, one or more of your collegues will come to your rescue. So! it's an opportunity to be "collaborative" 
                </p>

                        <li>You will experience the fundamentals of all Programming Languages.</li>
                        <li>You will experience using "Visual Studio Code" (VS Code) an "Integrated Development Environment"(IDE). 
                            It's just one of many available "software tools" indispensable to Computer Programmers. 
                        </li>
                        <li>You will learn the basics of Web Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).</li>
                        <li>You will learn the basics of GitHub, a professional version control system which is also where your Company Website is hosted.</li>
                        <li>You will learn the basics of C/C++ by programming the Arduino board.</li>
                        <li>You will experience programming the EEPROMs in "Digital" using JavaScript as well as programming actual EEPROMs utilizing C++ and Arduino.</li>
                        <li>You will experience being a "Design Engineer" and working with "Design Software" (Digital)</li>
                        <li>You will experience being an "Architect"/"Draftsman" by utilizing the software called "Fritzing".</li>
                        <li>You will have the opportunity to get your hands dirty by cutting and stripping wires and connecting parts according to the Draftman's Schematic.</li>
                        <li>You will have the opportunity to create "Vector" images using Inkscape.</li>
                        <li>You will have the opportunity to take pictures and modify them in GIMP (a free version of Photoshop)</li>
                        <li>You will have the opportunity to make videos of your work and modify them in Kdenlive (or DaVinciResolve - 
                            a free professionsl version -  if we can get a powerful enough computer to run it!)</li>
                        <li>You will have the opportunity to add "text", "images", "videos" etc to the Company WebSite on GitHub.
                        </li>
                        <li>Probably the most important learning experience you will have is "trouble shooting".
                            In every aspect of this project there will be mistakes: some minor, some catastrophic, some will be easy to detect
                            while others will not. Did you notice the mistake I just made? After catastrophic there should be a period(.) not a comma(,).
                            There's probably never been a computer programmer that hasn't beat their head against a wall trying to find errors like that!
                            When doing the final wiring on a "breadboard" it's not unusual to be "off by one"(eg a wire is put in one hole which should have been placed in the adjacent hole!).
                            When there are 10 other wires all bunched together around it, that one wire may be difficult to find, but find it you must because the computers going to
                            malfunction as it is!
                        </li>
                        <li>When everything is completed and working properly, you can pat each other on the back and say: "Job well done"! It's a Team effort!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
