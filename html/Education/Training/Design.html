            <p>As was mentioned before, this section is not necessary for this project. You will be using the 74LS-- series of ICs which have
                already been designed by Texas Instruments (TI) back in 1970. If, however, you have any inclinations towards Engineering as 
                a profession, this section is a must for you!
            </p>
            <p>Your boss hands you a set of "Inputs" and "Outputs" and asks you if you can design the circuitry for this set of data. 
                You have at your desposal the "basic" Gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR. If there are only a few Inputs and one Output you 
                may intuitively play around with the Gates and come up with a Solution. There's are better ways. One is called "Boolean Algebra". 
            </p>
            <p>Around the middle of the 19th century, a mathematician, George Boole, wondered whether or not "mathematics could be applied to how people think?". 
                He created a new field of mathematics called "Boolean Logic" and then, somewhat latter, "Boolean Algebra". It wasn't until 1937 that Claude Shannon in his 1937 master's thesis 
                made the connection between "Boolean Algebra" and "Electronic Relays"(Electrical Switches which are binary in nature). In 1945 the first "programmable computer", 
                ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was built utilizing Gates(AND, OR, NOT ie Boolean Algebra).
            </p>
            <p>It is this "Boolean Algebra" that provides us with a systematic tool for coming up with a solution to our problem.
                We will proceed in the following order:
                <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                    <li>Place Inputs and Outputs into a Truth Table</li>
                    <li>Use some characteristics of the Truth Table as an aid to make the conversion into Boolean Algebraic expressions and/or equations</li>
                    <li>Simplify/Solve them for your final "design circuit"</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Truth Tables and Boolean Algebra are two different entities. First consider Truth Tables. In general: 
                <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                    <li>Table Heads only contain "Labels"(<u>English words</u> and/or symbols ie "Inputs", "P<sub>0</sub>"), "Output" etc.</li>
                    <li>Table Bodies only contain Binary <u>Values</u> ie ("0","1").</li>
                </ol> 
            </p>
            <p>Now consider Boolean Algebra. It consists of:
                <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                    <li>"Boolean <u>Variables</u>"(eg P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>0</sub>)</li>
                    <li>"Boolean <u>Operators</u>"(eg AND, OR, NOT).</li>
                </ol><br>
                <p>Look at the following image:</p>
                <img class="container-label-contents-img" src="media/imgs/Container-Label-Contents.png">
                <p class="label-container-contents">
                    "Boolean Variables" can be viewed as a combination of: A Label, A Container, and
                    Contents of that Container, which can be "changed" over time.<br><br>
                    <!--<ul>
                        <li>A Label</li>
                        <li>A Container</li>
                        <li>Contents of that Container, which can be "changed" over time</li>
                    </ul><br>-->
                    NOTE: The Label(eg P<sub>0</sub>) in the Truth Table can also be thought of as a container(eg its contents is the Column below it
                    in the Table Body. This Content, however, is fixed by definition and cannot be changed: thus it's not a variable!)
                    Important: P<sub>0</sub> in the Truth Table is NOT the same as the Boolean variable P<sub>0</sub>.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will now make begin the translation. Keep in mind the fundamentals of Boolean Logic and Boolean Algebra: "AND", "OR", "NOT" 
                along with the English Words: "and", "or", "not". Would you be surprized if there is a close connection between them. 
            </p>  
                <!--<ol type="1">
                    <li>Step 1: From the Truth Table, write English sentences using the words ("state" & "or").</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Replace "state" with the Input/Output Names along with the English word "and".</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Convert the English sentences into Algebraic equations.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Simplify the Algebraic expressions.</li>
                </ol>  
                Note: The Algebra we are talking about now is called "Boolean Algebra". "Boolean Algebra" has an Algebraic structure and 
                is rightly called an Algebra but it does differ from the Algebra you learned in High School.  
                In Algebra you have Operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication etc)
                In "Boolean Algebra" you have Operators (AND, OR, NOT etc.). In Algebra you have Operands (Integers, fractions, decimal #'s, 
                irrational #'s etc). In Boolean Algebra you have "Binary" Operands ("0,1"), ("T,F"), or ("H,L") etc. 
            </p>-->
            <p>Consider the Truth Table for the NOT Gate.

                    Can P<sub>0</sub> be "0" and "1" AT THE SAME TIME?
                </p>      	 
                <div class="design-question-container">
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('b0-1-value-at-time-id')">Answer : </label>
                    <p id="b0-1-value-at-time-id" class="answer answer-hidden">NO! Binary is like your light switch at home. It can be "UP"(light on) 
                        or "DOWN"(light off) but <u>not both at the same time</u>!
                    </p> 
                </div>
                <p>Each <u>row</u> of the Truth Table, therefore, represets a unique "state". 
                    Thus we say the NOT Gate has two "states", where each row represents a particular "state".  
                </p>
                <p>Let's call row 1 "State 1(S1)" and row 2 "State 2(S2)". Hopefully the following "English" sentence makes sense:<br>
                    <br>The NOT Gate is <u>either</u> in "State 1"(row 1) <u>or</u> "State 2"(row 2).<br><br> 
                    The key word in that sentence is the English word "or". 
                </p>
                <p>Consider the following "English" sentence where "or" is replaced with "and":<br> 
                    <br>The NOT Gate is either in "State 1"(row 1) <u>and</u> "State 2"(row 2).<br>
                    Does that sentence make logical sense? The two words: ("either", "and") don't go together but ("either", "or") do!
                </p>
                <p>Now consider the following Truth Table.

                <p>Now write the English sentence for State<u>s</u> where the Output is equal to 0.
                    Hint: "or"!

                </div>
            </p><br>
            <p>Step 2: Replace "state" with the Input Names along with the English word "and".
                <p>Consider row 4 ("state 4" ie S4) in the table above. The values for the Inputs are P<sub>1</sub> = 1 and  P<sub>0</sub> = 1.<br>
                State 4 (S4) could be expressed as: P<sub>1</sub> = 1  ?   P<sub>0</sub> = 1.<br> What sounds more logical?
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>P<sub>1</sub> = 1  "and"   P<sub>0</sub> = 1</li>
                        <li>P<sub>1</sub> = 1  "or"   P<sub>0</sub> = 1</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div>
                        <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('b1-and-b0-id')">Answer:</label>
                        <p id="b1-and-b0-id" class="answer answer-hidden">a: (P<sub>1</sub> = 1) <u>and</u> (P<sub>0</sub> = 1)<br>
                            Row 4(S4) is characterized by <u>both</u> Inputs being 1! If <u>either</u> Input = 0 you would be in a different state
                            other than S4 (ie S1 or S2 or S3). The word "or" only requires "ONE" Input to be 1; on the other hand, "and" requires "both"
                            Inputs to have a value of "1". 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>For the Truth Table above, only state 4 has an Output with a value of 1; on the other hand, it has 3 states with a corresponding 
                    value of "0": S1, S2, S3. Previously we learned that we could write the following sentence for multiple rows(states) = 0:<br>S1 "or" S2 "or" S3 equals 0.<br>
                    Re-write this English statement by replacing the S1, S2 and S3 with the approximate expressions for P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('s1-s2-s3-0-id')">Answer : </label>
                    <label id="s1-s2-s3-0-id" class="answer answer-hidden">[(P<sub>1</sub> = 0) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 0)] or [(P<sub>1</sub> = 0) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 1)] or [(P<sub>1</sub> = 1) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 0)] equals 0</label>
                </div> 
            </p>
            <p>Step 3: Convert the English sentences into Algebraic equations.<br>
                We now have the two English sentences for the Truth Table above:
                <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                    <li>[(P<sub>1</sub> = 0) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 0)] or [(P<sub>1</sub> = 0) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 1)] or [(P<sub>1</sub> = 1) and (B<sub>0</sub> = 0)] equals 0</li>
                    <li>[(P<sub>1</sub> = 1) and (P<sub>0</sub> = 1)] equals 1</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We need to convert these into an Boolean Algebraic Equation! But how? First consider the following:<br>
                    For the English Expressions we have:
                    <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                        <li>labels: P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>0</sub> which are English Labels(NOT Variables)</li>
                        <li>numeric values: 0, 1</li>
                        <li>words: "and", "or", "equals"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>For Boolean Algebra we have:</p>
                    <ol type="1" class="type-1">
                        <li>variable: such as P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>0</sub></li>
                        <li>numeric values(operands): 0, 1</li>
                        <li>Logic Gates(operators): "AND", "OR", "="</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Replace "and" with "AND", "or" with "OR", "equals" with "=".
                    The <u></u>Output</u> values are fixed values in both cases: 0 or 1. Nothing needs to be done!
                </p>
                <p>As was mentioned previously, the labels P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> of the Truth Table cannot be directly replaced
                    with the labels for the corresponding Algebraic Variables. The following is not obvious but after you think about it, 
                    it does make sense. We'll use P<sub>0</sub> as an example.
                </p> 
                <p class="label-container-contents">P<sub>0</sub> is a Variable which can have a Value of "0" or "1". Consider NOT P<sub>0</sub>. It also can have a Value of
                    "0" or "1". The NOT operator, however, reverses the Value in P<sub>0</sub> (eg if P<sub>0</sub>) = 0 
                    then NOT P<sub>0</sub> = 1. If P<sub>0</sub> = 1 then NOT P<sub>0</sub> = 0. Thus we can two options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace "0" with P<sub>0</sub></li>
                        <li>and replace "1" with NOT P<sub>0</sub></li>
                    </ul>or
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace "1" with P<sub>0</sub></li>
                        <li>and replace "0" with NOT P<sub>0</sub></li>
                    </ul>
                    While both options will work, it turns out the 2<sup>nd</sup> option is preferable.
                </p>
                <p>For State 2(S2) the Input Values for P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> are "0", "1" or "P<sub>1</sub>", "NOT P<sub>0</sub>"
                    where the first pair P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>0</sub> are Truth Table Lables and the latter pair "P<sub>1</sub>", "NOT P<sub>0</sub> 
                    are Boolean Variables!
                </p>
                <p> State 2(S2) can now be expressed as: P<sub>1</sub> AND "NOT P<sub>0</sub>, which is a Boolean Expression where 
                    "P<sub>1</sub>", P<sub>0</sub> are Boolean Variables and "AND", "NOT" are Boolean Operators. 
                </p>
                <p>Repeat this for States 1,3,4</p>
