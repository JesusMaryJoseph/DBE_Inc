                <article>
                    <p>Consider the following scenario: Two people are having a discussion about building a computer. The first person is a Computer Programmer and 
                        the second person is an Electrical(Digital) Engineer. Each person is well versed in their respective fields and knows next to nothing about 
                        the other field of interest. It looks like the two people are having a conversation where each is speaking in a language foreign to the other!
                    </p>
                    <p>The Computer Programmer is using terms like: "data", "data structures", "subroutines", "object oriented programming" and the like. The Engineer, 
                        on the other hand, is using terms like: "Voltages", "Current", "Transistors", "ICs" etc. It would appear that nothing good is going
                        to come about from this discussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>But what's happening here is a discussion that is centered about "the language that the computer programmer would like to have" and "the electrical components" 
                        the Engineer feels can be built. For example: The Computer Programmer needs to STORE both the language and the data while the Engineer is thinking about 
                        "filp-flops", "registers", RandomAccessMemory(RAM). The Computer Programmer is thinking about memory and the Engineer is saying: I've got you covered.
                        The Computer Programmer wants to add numbers and perform basic Logic operations (NOT, OR, AND etc). The Engineer is thinking about Intergrated Circuits
                        (ICs): 4-bit arithmetic IC (74LS283), HEX NOT Gates (74LS04), Quad 2-Input OR Gate (74LS32), Quad 2-Input AND Gate (74LS08) etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>In essence the two are creating a CONTRACT between themselves: composed of:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>the Language(Software) of this computer</li>
                            <li>the Electrical components(Hardware) needed to execute the language</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>The CONTRACT is called the "Instruction Set Architecture" (ISA). Every Computer has a specific ISA. All PC's have the x86 ISA, which is comprised of
                    approximately 1000 commands. Proceed to the "Software Architecture" first to see which commands your computer will have and then go to the "Hardware Architecture" 
                    to see the Electrical Components that will be used to build your 8-bit Computer.
