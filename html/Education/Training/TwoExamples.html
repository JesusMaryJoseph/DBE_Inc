                <h1>Codes: Two Examples</h1>
                <h1>First Example: The English Language</h1>
                <p>As we saw in the introduction, a language, Navajo, can be considered as a code, even a secret code and it can be very effective! In fact every language unfamiliar to a person is a secret code to them.</p> 
                <p>Consider the following sentence:
                <label>“Jewe ndi inzira, n’ukuri, n’ubuzima.</label>
                <p>Unless you are familiar with Kirundi, which is the native language of the people who live in Burundi, Africa, that sentence conveys no meaning to you whatsoever. To learn and be fluent in Kirundi would be very difficult to say the least. For everyone, learning their first language was difficult and took many, many years before they were fluent in it. Fortunately the computer codes are not that difficult to learn but will still take a fair amount of effort!</p>
                <p>To help us in that regard we will consider the one language we know: English. It is both a spoken and written language. All the written words are composed of letters and all the spoken words are composed of basic sounds, called phonemes. While you probably know that there are 26 letters, you may not know how many phonemes there are.</p>
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('phonemes-id')">Answer = </label>
                    <label id="phonemes-id" class="answer-hidden">approximately 44. <a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/sites/default/files/migrated/the-44-phonemes-of-english.pdf"  target='_blank' and rel='noopener noreferrer'>See</a></label>
                </div> 
                <p>Now consider English as a written language. Every "word" is composed of one or more "letters". We will call each "letter" of a "word" a “bit”. Thus the word "train" is composed of 5 letters and is therefore called a 5-bit word. "hello" is also a 5-bit word even though the letter "l" occurs twice!</p>
                <p>Next question: how many 2-bit words "could" there be in the English Language?</p>
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('one-bit-words-id')">Answer = </label>
                    <label id="one-bit-words-id" class="answer-hidden">(26x26) or 26<sup>2</sup> = 676</label>
                </div>
                <p>Aside Question: How many 2-bit words are there in the English Language?</p>
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('two-bit-english-words-id')">Answer = </label>
                    <label id="two-bit-english-words-id" class="answer-hidden">127</label>
                </div>
                <p>How many 3-bit words "could" there be?<p>
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('three-bit-words-id')">Answer = </label>
                    <label id="three-bit-words-id" class="answer-hidden">(26x26x26) or 26<sup>3</sup> = 17,576</label>
                </div>
                <p>Final question: How many n-bit words could there be in the English Language?</p> 
                <div>
                    <label class="question" onclick="QuestionAnswerManager.revealAnswer('n-bit-words-id')">Answer = </label>

                </div>
                <p>In like manner we can consider the English Language as a spoken language. Each individual sound, phoneme, could then be considered as a "1-bit" "spoken word".</p>
                <p>How many 2-bit "spoken words" could we pronounce?</p>
                <div>

                </div>

                </div>
                <p>In general how many n-bit words could we pronounce?</p>
                <div>

                </div>
                <h1 class="header-example-morse-code">Second Example: Morse Code</h1>
                <p>Play the two audio files below. They both play the same message; however, the first one plays the message once, while
                    the second one plays the message several times. Do you recognize the message?
                </p>
                <audio src="media/audio/sos-signal-1.mp3" controls></audio>
                <audio src="media/audio/sos-signal.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p>It's Morse Code for S-O-S.</p>
                <P>Can you describe the audio signal for the letter S? For the letter O? How many distinct sounds do you hear?</P>
                <p>Here's what it sounds like in Audacity, which is an audio app.
                    <video src="media/audio/SOS-audacity-resized.mp4" controls width="400"></video>
                </p>
                <p>Here's an image of the SOS signal from Audacity

                    How would you describe the three sound waves for the letter S?
                    Likewise a description for the three sound waves for the O letter?
                    If we say the S is compossed of 3 dots and the O is composed of 3 dashes,
                    the length of one dash is _?__ times the length of one dot.

                </p>
                <p>Morse Code is a "binary" code. All letters of the English are represented by combinations of these two binary values(dot & dash). 
                    The dash being 3 times as long as a dot. Remember in Binary each bit can only have 2 values so:<br>

                    Out of the 30 possibilities Samuel Morse had to choose 26 and then assign letters to each one.
                </p>
                <p>Here is Samuel Morse's "key":</p>

                <p>It is not the intent that you become proficient in Morse Code; however, 
                    since Morse Code is binary in nature, there are specific things we can learn from it. 
                    One of these is "Truth Tables" (ie "Key"), which you will definitely encounter in this project!
