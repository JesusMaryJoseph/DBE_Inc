                <p>Every Profession has basic tools (equipment) and techniques, which must be mastered. For Artists it's paper, pencils, pens, inks, brushes, etc.
                Mechnics: Hand tools, power tools, nails, screws etc. Regradless of Profession, a Professional in any endeavor is one who is well grounded in the fundamentals,
                utilizes the fundamentals of their trade in exceptional and creative ways and, most likely, has a great love for what they do.
                </p>
                <!--For you who are Chesterton students, you study the Classics
                For us who are Catholics Church has classified certain individuals as Saints! They're the Professionals of the Church: Well grounded in the Fundamentals Faith, Hope, Love, Poverty, Chastity, Obedience, Meekness & Humility.
                They excelled in how they put these fundamentals into action and, without a doubt, were driven by Love.
                </p>-->
                <p>In this section you will be introduced to "Logic Gates" and "Integrated Circuits (ICs)". They are your Fundamentals for this project. Know them!

            <section class="not-and-or-gates">
                <p>Directly below is the Truth Table for the simplest Logic Gate. One difference with this Truth Table is the inclusion
                    of the "Design Circuitry" column located between the "Inputs" and "Outputs". They are related!
                </p>
                <p>A typical Engineering problem is: given the Inputs and Outputs, 
                    the Engineer must use their knowledge and skills, in a creative way, to come up with the "Digital Circuitry" that satisfies that criteria!
                    In the next section, "Design", you will be learn two tools, "Boolean Algebra" and "Karnaugh Maps", that will help in this process.
                </p>
                <p>The focus right now is the "Logic Gates" themselves. The following Truth Table is for the "Simplist" Logic Gate.
                    Without looking at the paragraph below the Truth Table, try to come up with a "name" for this Gate on your own.

                <p>As you can see, this Gate has One Input and One Output. Notice also that the Output has the opposite value of the Input. 
                    In Binary there are only 2 values. So, if it is not "one Value" it must be the "other Value"; therefore, it makes sense for 
                        this Logic Gate to be called the "NOT" Gate. Its symbol is:
                    <img class="not-gate" src="media/imgs/basicLogicGates/NOT_Gate.svg">, where the Input is on its left and the Output on its right.<br>
                    <label>( "F" <img class="not-gate" src="media/imgs/basicLogicGates/NOT_Gate.svg"> "T")</label>
                </p>
                <p>Consider the many years you studied Arithmatic. You encountered Numbers (Operands) and Operators (addition, subtraction, multiplications, division). Now enter "The Binary World" 
                    where you find Operands (eg "T"/"F") and Operators, one of which is the NOT Gate.
                </p>
                <p>The NOT Gate is similar to Square Root in that it only operates on "One" Value (Operand).
                    Forgetting +/- one would write the (Square Root of 4) = 2 as: <img class="square-root" src="media/imgs/squareRoot_4.svg">. The same expression could have been written with 
                        the argument (Input) first, followed by the Square Root (Operator) and then immediately followed by the Result, 
                        <img class="square-root" src="media/imgs/4_SquareRoot_2.svg"> , with which you, undoubtedly, feel uncomfortable but which you will be doing from now on.
                    The Inputs come first then the Logic Gate followed immediately by its Output<br> eg (Input <img class="not-gate" src="media/imgs/basicLogicGates/NOT_Gate.svg"> Output)<br>

                <p>One Note before covering the remaining "Basic Logic Gates": In Binary the two "values" can be represented many different ways: "up"/"down", "High"/"Low", "5volts"/"0volts", "cake"/"ice cream" but the 
                    most common pairs that you will see are: "0"/"1", "F"/"T" and "H"/"L". You will be given the opportunity to switch back and forth between "0"/"1" and "F"/"T"
                    but practice with both options. 
                </p>
                <p>There are three more Basic Logic Gates: AND, OR and XOR. XOR is pronounced as Exclusive OR and means:
                    One or the other but "NOT BOTH".
                </p> 
                <p>The Negative of these Gates are:NAND, NOR, NXOR where:<br>
                    NAND == NOT(AND), NOR == NOT(OR), NXOR == NOT(XOR).
                </p>
                <p>The following table will allow you to practice with these 6 Gates. Spend enough time with them so
                     their "DEFINITIONS" and "SYMBOLS" are firmly grounded in your mind!

            <section class="intro-ics">
                <p>One of the circuits in the "Circuit Practice Table" above was different than all the others.
                    Did you notice it? It also had a unique label separating it from all the others, which
                    were composed of "basic" Logic Gates throwing together without much thought.
                </p>
                <p>The circuit diagram for "TwoToFourDecoder", however, has a very different look to it. Go back and run it again but 
                    this time consentrate on the 4 output columns. Do you see a pattern? It not only has a very organized output it also
                    performs a very useful function, which is why TI manufactored it as 74LS139 with the label: "dual 2-Line To 4-Line Decoder/Demultiplexer".
                </p>
                <div class="ic-container ic-139-container">

                </div>
                <p>As you can see from the image above, it actually contains two "2-Line To 4-Line Decoder/Demultiplexers". 
                    When designing the Output Module, you will use the 74LS139 to control which of the Four 7-Segment-Display will be lit at any one time.
                </p>
                <p>The 74LS139 Integrated Circuit is only one of 18 ICs you will be using to build the 8-bit computer. Six of the 18 will
                    be introduced to you right now. The remaining 12 will be covered after you have finished the "Hardware Architecture" material.
                </p>
                <p>All the ICs look pretty much the same, differing in size and the number of pins. The following 6 ICs
                    could easily be called the "basic" ICs as seen by the following list:</p>

                <p>NOTE: When working as an Engineer you will have access to both the single "AND Gate" as well as the "74LS08 IC"; however,
                    when working as a Draftsman or Technician you will ONLY have access to the "74LS08 IC". So if the Engineer chooses
                    to use a single "AND Gate" in their "Design", the Draftsman's Schematic will have to convert that single "AND Gate"
                    into a 74LS08 IC!
                </p>
                <p>Take some time to memorize each particular Gate with its corresponding IC name (eg OR Gate -- 74LS32 IC etc.). Your'e ready
                    for the "Design" section.
